C++ Starting Kit for Sublime Text
=================================

## Features
* C, C++ and C++11 combined and improved syntax highlighting support.
* Custom C++ build system for g++ compiler.

**/!\ It is highly recommended to read the Philosophy section just below before to install and use this package. /!\**

## Philosophy
The main objective of this project is to provide a fully functional and self-contained starting toolkit for beginners(like me) with C++ and Sublime Text including :
* A syntax definition which gives you the flexibility to make precise customizations to your syntax highlighting.
* An associated theme which includes all the new scopes. (see Oasis Theme)
* An intelligible build system.
* A relevant documentation for a quick start and an accessible maintenance.

**I have to mention two major things before to continue :**

* First, I'm really new in the huge world of programming. The first release of this package is the result of my first week of learning. My original goal is to learn C++ with a lightweight and flexible tool. A tool which allow me to customize my environment and let me control things like compiling. This was not an easy task because of the huge amount of solutions available out there. Finally Sublime Text seems to suit pretty well to my needs with his reasonable learning curve. 
* The second thing I want to mention is, in my opinion, **this package is not ready for production**. Even if the main behaviors are ever described and seem to work correctly, I think it will demand you a certain investment before to make it fully functional in a professional environment. 

But don't worry, as it is my primary tool for my journey to C++, be sure that it will be updated and fully functional as quick as possible.

THE GUIDE
=========
This guide covers the management of this package with Sublime Text 3 under Windows. You can "translate" specific manipulations for your version of Sublime Text or your operating system by a quick research on the Internet.

How to customize your syntax highlighting
=========================================
# Prerequisite

## Syntax definition design

The syntax definition allow the syntax highlighting.
To be able to quickly get a result only the necessary pieces of code were modified :
* C.tmLanguage and C++.tmLanguage, which were mainly responsible of the syntax definition, were merged into CCpp.tmLanguage.
* C++.sublime-build, which embed the build system, was customized and renamed in CCpp.sublime-build.
* C++.sublime-settings, which specifies the supported file types, was just renamed in CCpp.sublime-settings. 
* All the other files were preserved.

To keep a flexible and easily maintainable system it was necessary to analyze, cut out and document the original code. Then extract useful pieces, merge them and reorganize the whole. (see CCpp.tmLanguage)

The greatest part of the changes are in the CCpp.tmLanguage. Now it is organized and documented to facilitate his approach and his maintenance. Functional pieces like comments, quoted strings or preprocessor modules are untouched.

**Important**
This package was coded with a very simple approach. A main behavior is describe then smaller tweaks came to get the desirable result.

For example the curly brackets were defined as open.curly.bracket.ccpp and close.curly.bracket.ccpp. Then open.curly.bracket.block.ccpp and close.curly.bracket.block.ccpp were added to override the first scopes and define the "block detection" behavior.

If you want to do something like that you have to put the main behavior at the bottom of your overrides, and not opposite !!!

## Manipulate *.sublime-package format

*.sublime-package like CCpp.sublime-package are *.zip archive. If you want to modify files inside this package you have to follow these steps :
* Inside your Sublime Text/Packages folder you have to find the package you want to modify.
* Copy and paste it in a safe place and do your tweaks on this copy.
* To open the package you have to rename it *.zip then extract it in the same folder.
* Inside the extracted folder you will find the editable files.
* When finished, save your changes.
* Close Sublime Text. 
* "Re-archive" your extracted folder in *.zip then rename it in *.sublime-package.
* Copy your updated *.sublime-package and overwrite the one in your Sublime Text/Packages folder.
* Restart Sublime Text.

## Edit your theme
Retrieve a scope name :
* Put your cursor under the scope you want to know the name.
* Type Ctrl + Alt + Shift + P.

The you need to open your theme file.

Locate your *.tmTheme
* Default themes are located in Sublime Text/Packages/Color Scheme - Default.sublime-package. 
* User themes are located in Sublime Text/Data/Packages/User.

Explore your *tmTheme
* Make a search by typing Ctrl + F.
* Type what you want to find and don't forget to look everywhere in the document by pressing Find and Find Prev.

Support a missing scope
If you are sure that the scope doesn't exist in your list, add the following lines and customize them :

		<dict>
			<key>name</key>
			<string>Scope name</string> 		<!-- Enter a name for your scope here. -->
			<key>scope</key>
			<string>Scope definition</string> 	<!-- Enter your scopes here. (ex : keyword.ccpp) -->
			<key>settings</key>
			<dict>
				<key>fontStyle</key>
				<string></string> 				<!-- Choose a style (ex : italic, bold, italic bold) -->
				<key>foreground</key>
				<string></string> 				<!-- Choose a color (ex : #49a629) -->
			</dict>
		</dict>
